 In this project in main.py we analyze the network with important metrics then we try to generate model that fit to this network and our last job is to detect the communitys of this network and find the modular metric 
Next project main2.py we try to fit our model to our dataset with using deep learning methods and you can find the results in final.png and final2_finally.png the name was chosen like this because I worked about 3 or 4 days for this result :)
